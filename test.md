# State of Computing

Computing in general is in a very weird place... We are looking at the internet as a toddler right now. If you stop and think about computers and the age of the internet, it literally is a little toddler that has only been walking for a couple years and can barely talk. Let me explain.

There was a 'super' period of computing, where everything was 'new'. Anything being designed was brand new and never before seen. There weren't these super mega tech companies dominating the world yet; I meant there were big tech companies during the beginning but not like today. Everyone and there mother who was smart, or not haha, was developing anything they wanted... there were no rules, just build. And this was the baby period of computing. Coding was just beginning to take off and developers were forced to learn very close to the metal, low level, design patterns. The world of computing imagination was endless and there was plenty of room to do anything you wanted.

Overtime people started realizing that computing was becoming something big, something that the whole world would look to and rely on. People made many different assumptions and some struck out and others hit big. Computing became more popular and more consumer friendly. Soon everyone started having computers in their houses. Schools started teaching people computing systems to children at young ages. Cell phones started becoming more advanced and we started moving out computing processes slowly over to the phone, making it easier to perform our everyday tasks on the go.

Coding also started changing. We started seeing some of these lower level ideas abstracted away from easier systems and more automation. We say the birth of languages like Java for enterprise systems and the birth of JavaScript to take over the browser world. We also saw Python released as a easy to use and easy to type language for quick development. These languages quickly became top tier and took over their respective spaces: enterprise systems, browser/web development and software development. These languages opened up so many new possibilities for the developer as they were very powerful and didn't require vast low level memory management knowledge.

Computing starts taking off, developers start growing, students start learning, and big companies start marking their territory. We see the massive growth of Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Facebook, and many more... These companies start taking what once was an imagination art canvas and start draw hard black lines into cookie cutter shapes. They quickly develop their mark in the computing space and push to standardize their products and services. We see Windows take over as the go to OS for the world. Apple starts making massive headway in the mobile and tablet space. Google starts developing tools to control large portions of the internet space. Facebook and MySpace pave the way for social interaction that happens within the digital world, making people more used to these digital interactions.

This is obviously a very small lens of the computing space, and not even close to the full picture of whats going on. But I wrote out some of this history to make the point that the computing space, which once was full of dreamers and creators has quickly been bought up by large tech companies telling you how your supposed to use what once was considered a free space. Data in computing became power and money very quickly and people marked their space in the digital world and took their share of the cut.

Tieing this all together, the general theme is computing isn't a baby anymore. The baby has developed a large portion of its thoughts and is now heading down a path. The issue is the path of the computing baby wasn't decided by the users, it was forced by the corporations that were powerful enough to push their motive. Google and Microsoft are shaping the path that we taking in the digital world and it is very carefully calculated.

My challenge is to fight against falling into the 'standard' digital space and lifestyle. Spend some time learning something new about the digital world you rely on everyday. We as a people have been forced to walk down big-techs idea for the internet. Dreamers are dying and people are missing out on something so amazing. Be creative and force yourself to grow in knowledge, don't let the world tell you how to think. Going back to coding, we have seen new languages come over time that have simplified many aspects for the developer. And while this is great, you also loose the understanding that is so powerful. I think there are many great coders today, but there are also many cookie cutter coders that lack true depth in their coding.

The trend seems to be, computing has been 'defined' enough now and instead of developing new things we are just going to build upon what is already there. I fear this as a large danger for the future. I am not asking to bring computing back into a baby, just don't let others define the path it's taking. Be free, think free!
